Once upon a time there was a wombat called Zazuu.
They really like coffee
They are extra tired today so away to coffee shop they go!
They order a large coffee with an extra shot of expresso


And maybe one more shot of espresso to make it triple
Sharing sits in their tiny mini
A extra shot means they are ready for the show
Finishing their party with a ritual of mojito

At a heightened pace with caffeinated grace
Zazuu zooms from place to place!
This was a story about a wombat called Zazuu.
A wombat that really likes coffee.
