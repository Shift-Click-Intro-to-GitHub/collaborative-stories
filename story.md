Once upon a time there was a wombat called Zazuu.
They really like coffee
They are extra tired today so away to coffee shop they go!
They order a large coffee with an extra shot of expresso

T - but the usual coffee shop Zazuu always liked so much turned them away at the door, with a mean stare and a abrupt gesture, for no explicable reason Zazuu could disern. 

N - Determined to not let this ruin his day, Zazuu started thinking. He started planning. He started scheming.

T- rubbing his hands inconspicuously together, he went to the next coffee shop, the one he liked a little bit less, and at the threshhold, once again, was turned away by an indifferent wave of the owners hand.
