Once upon a time there was a wombat called Zazuu.
They really like coffee
They are extra tired today so away to coffee shop they go!
They order a large coffee with an extra shot of expresso

T - but the usual coffee shop Zazuu always liked so much turned them away at the door, with a mean stare and a abrupt gesture, for no explicable reason Zazuu could discern. 

N - Determined to not let this ruin his day, Zazuu started thinking. He started planning. He started scheming.

T - rubbing his hands inconspicuously together, he went to the next coffee shop, the one he liked a little bit less, and at the threshhold, once again, was turned away by an indifferent wave of the owners hand. 

N - With a furrow of his brow, Zazuu stared through the window, committing this to memory. He had to come up with a plan. Did he want revenge? Did he want to move on and hope third time was the charm? Zazuu narrowed his eyes, and decided to try his luck at the next coffee shop, if he got his coffee, everything would be forgiven. If not, he would have to find a way to make everyone sorry for denying him his coffee. 

T- Caffine withdrawl had begun working its way through his little wombat body, a feeling Zazuu had felt maybe once but that memory existed outside the bounds of his memory. Fatigue and indignation create a very concerning confluence, especially in a wombat so inclined as Zazuu. He smacked the flat of his palm of the third coffee shop's window, this one he really hated. Like a feral wombat, foam spewing from his mouth, he shouted incoherent words through the glass that we think had something to do with exchanging money for a coffee-like commodity. Zazuu's mother was in this coffee shop, and Zazuu quickly remembered why this was his least favourite shop to get coffee from.
