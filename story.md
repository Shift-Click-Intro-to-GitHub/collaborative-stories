Once upon a time there was a wombat called Zazuu.
They really like coffee
They are extra tired today so away to coffee shop they go!
They order a large coffee with an extra shot of expresso

but the usual coffee shop Zazuu always liked so much turned them away at the door, with a mean stare and a abrupt gesture, for no explicable reason Zazuu could disern.
