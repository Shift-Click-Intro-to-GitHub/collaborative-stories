Once upon a time, in a galaxy far far away there was a large reptile entering a fine establishment, walking upright on it's back legs. One might wonder why such a beast would act in such a way.

He was a crocodile, and his name was Croaki. He was no ordinary crocodile, for he could speak English and walk on his hind legs.

He also had dreams, big dreams. He walked into this fine establishment in his suit and tie, for a job interview, as he wants to be a Michelin Star Chef.

His mother always told him as a Crockling that he could achieve his wildest dreams. But unfortuantely for Croaki, his dreams of becoming a chef will be difficult, as he has no thumbs.

The interviewer said to him, "How do you expect to flip omlettes? You can't wrap your thumb around a spatula."

Croaki went home with his head hanging low. He wanted nothing more than to become a chef.

He cracked open a chilled bottle of Corona and sat on the couch in front of the TV.
