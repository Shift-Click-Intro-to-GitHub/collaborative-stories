Capy, the capybara, lived in the heart of the forest. She was loved by all as she was kind and caring, always ready to help her fellow creatures in times of need.

The capybara then got really into crypto and is now homeless. Oops!

50 years have passed since the total breakdown of worldwide crypto society. The value of gold has risen tremendously tipping the balance of national powers worldwide. Capy B Ara (our protagonist) now destitute and lost within the overtuning financial chaos turns to seeking rare minerals in South Sudan. This is the beginning of the story of how the forgotten land mammal became the driving force into the space age.
