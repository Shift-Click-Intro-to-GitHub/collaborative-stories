Once upon a time there was a flower boquet on the floor
While a girl was walking in the park 
She noticed the day was shine and bright
She walked passed the flower boquet that was shining on the floor with glitter
She grabbed the bouquet to give to your mother 
while waliking back to home she noticed something different 
On the floor she saw some money it felt like her lucky day which she has never had before
